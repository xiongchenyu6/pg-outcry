-- Fixes found driving the live demo: a logged-in user could stake / open a perp
-- (the writes succeeded — balances moved) but their position views came back empty
-- or errored. Two distinct causes, both in the derivative migrations:
--
-- 1) banker_round() EXECUTE. 9900_lockdown revokes EXECUTE on every public function
--    from anon/authenticated and re-grants only a whitelist; banker_round() was left
--    off it. my_stakes is security_invoker and calls banker_round() to show the live
--    pending reward, so reading it raised "permission denied for function
--    banker_round". It is an IMMUTABLE pure rounding helper that reads nothing, so
--    granting EXECUTE is safe.
--
-- 2) Public market tables had RLS enabled with NO policy on hosted (switched on
--    out-of-band by the Supabase security advisor — the migrations themselves only
--    enabled RLS on the *position* tables, so CI never reproduced this). stake_pool
--    and perp_market hold public market data (APR / total staked / mark price /
--    funding) and are joined by the security_invoker views my_stakes and my_perp.
--    With RLS on and no SELECT policy, those joins returned zero rows for
--    authenticated, so positions never showed even though stake_position /
--    perp_position had the row. (The stake_pools / perp_markets *views* worked
--    because they're security-definer and bypass RLS.) Make this declarative: enable
--    RLS here too (so CI == hosted == the migration) and add public read policies.
--    margin_config is read only via security-definer views (margin_terms /
--    my_margin_health), so it needs no policy.
--
-- Numbered >9900 so the lockdown's revoke loop has already run.
