# Derivatives & staking in pure Postgres — feasibility + plan

Can margin / futures / staking be done in pure PG, and what extensions help?

> [OpenCEX](https://github.com/Polygant/OpenCEX), or [OPEX](https://github.com/opexdev/core) implement
> these in **open source** — they're spot exchanges. peatio's margin/perps/P2P live only in Openware's
> *commercial* OpenDAX; OpenCEX/OPEX don't ship them. So there's no OSS reference to copy — the design

## Verdict

All three are achievable in pure PostgreSQL with **only `pg_cron` + `pg_net`** (already in use) — **no
new bespoke extension required**. Effort: **staking (small) < spot margin (moderate) < perpetual
futures (large)**. The only inherently-external dependency is a **price oracle** (index/mark for
liquidation & funding), fetched the same way as on-chain deposits. The real cost is the **risk
surface** (liquidations, funding, insurance fund), not the database.

## Extension map (grounded in the Supabase image)

| Extension | Helps with | Status here |
|---|---|---|
| **pg_cron** | accrual / funding / liquidation / unbonding timers | ✅ installed |
| **pg_net** / **http** | external index/oracle price feeds | ✅ installed |
| **pgmq** | durable queues: unbonding, liquidation, funding, withdrawals (vs hand-rolled `SKIP LOCKED`) | ✅ available — **now used for staking unbonding** |
| **pg_partman** | auto-partition time-series (funding payments, mark-price history) | ✅ available |
| **pgsodium** | ed25519 signing in-DB → **Solana/Sui** withdrawals/stake txs natively | ✅ available |
| **supabase_vault** | encrypt the hot signer key at rest if signing in-DB | ✅ installed |
| **wrappers** (FDW) | model an external price API / exchange as a foreign table (oracle) | ✅ available |
| **plpgsql_check** · **pgtap** | static-check + unit-test the large risk engine | ✅ available |
| **pgaudit** | compliance-grade audit logging for the regulated surface | ✅ available |
| _TimescaleDB / toolkit_ | hypertables + continuous aggregates → server-side OHLCV, mark/funding series | ❌ **not in the image** (self-host only) |
| _plv8 / plpython3u_ | in-DB JS/Python (e.g. a secp256k1 lib) | ❌ not available |

**Signing nuance:** **ed25519 chains (Solana, Sui)** can be signed *in-DB* with `pgsodium` (+ key in
`supabase_vault`). **secp256k1 chains (BTC, all EVM, Tron)** have no stock extension → external signer
(current design) or a **custom C extension** compiling `libsecp256k1` (same pattern as `oc_fastmath`).

## 1. Staking — ✅ shipped (migration `9930`)

Stake a currency, earn rewards (APR) via a reward-per-token accumulator (MasterChef pattern, settled
lazily on each interaction — no accrual cron), unstake with an unbonding period.

- Money movement reuses `process_transfer`, so reconciliation holds: **stake** = `WITHDRAWAL` user→MASTER
  (locks principal), **reward** = `DEPOSIT` MASTER→user (issuance, like a faucet), **unbond** =
  `DEPOSIT` MASTER→user after the delay.
- **pgmq** holds the unbonding queue (`pgmq.send(..., delay)`); a **pg_cron** job `process_unbonding()`
  drains matured messages and returns principal.
- RPCs: `stake` / `unstake` / `claim_stake_rewards` (authenticated); views `my_stakes` (live pending
  reward) + `stake_pools`. Verified in `scripts/smoke-features.mjs` (stake → ~10 reward at 10% APR →
  unstake → unbond release → **reconcile() all PASS**).

## 2. Spot margin — planned (pure SQL)

Borrow against collateral → interest accrues (`pg_cron`) → `place_order` checks equity ≥ initial
margin → a **liquidation engine** marks positions to the last trade / index and force-closes via
market orders when equity < maintenance margin; insurance fund covers shortfalls. New pieces: borrow
ledger, margin check, and the liquidation monitor (a **pgmq** work-queue drained by a worker). No new
extension.

## 3. Perpetual futures — planned (large, pure SQL)

Position-based, not balance-based:
1. **Index + mark price** — index from external spot markets via `pg_net`/`wrappers` (the one external dependency).
2. **Funding** — periodic long/short transfer (`pg_cron`).
3. **uPnL / equity**, initial/maintenance margin.
4. **Liquidation** (**pgmq** queue) + **insurance fund** + **ADL**.
5. Matching stays an order book; settlement updates **positions + margin** (a new path alongside spot).

All numeric math; **pg_partman** for the funding/mark-price time-series; a custom C extension for the
hot funding/liquidation loop is optional at scale.

## Roadmap

`staking ✅ → spot margin → perpetual futures`. Each is opt-in and carries real financial risk — these
sit at the regulated end ([WHY.md §9](./WHY.md#9-when-not-to-use-this)); pg-outcry's core remains a
correctness-first **spot** exchange.
